                    <p class="lead">Being able to communicate with other people is a necessary skill for every human being. We want to make a game that helps people step out of their closed boxes and communicate better with each other. We decided on a game that is easy to learn and recognize. Everybody knows Tetris! But this game requires cooperation in a 3D game world.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Our goals were to promote communication and cooperation between players, and make a fun and addicting game that it both easy to learn and interesting to play over and over again. </p>

                    <p>"Really challenging, but fun", Oh, it's 3D!", "Great for making enemies!"</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">How does Teamtris work?</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Each player holds a Wii-mote and controls the movements with buttons. The main motivation of Wii-motes was the combination of wireless, suitable for the task and a well known controller that a lot of people recognize. We did also add a backlog item for remaking the Wii-motes into T-shape tetriminos and control the game by rotating and moving the controllers. This will make use of the 3-degree tilt sensor and the 3-degree accelerometers of the classic Wii-mote.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Tetris is a classic game associated with simple block graphics on old computer screens. We are indeed using a state of art 3D game engine, but we decided to hold back a bit on the graphics to keep the retro feeling.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Challenges and lessons learned.</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Something which we did not anticipate early on was how comparatively easy it would be to develop in Unity compared to raw OpenGL as some of us had done earlier. Even very difficult parts such as proper wiimote implementation worked almost flawlessly. Therefore we reached our preliminary goals unexpectedly soon which affected the rest of the development plans. Regarding the interactions, we initially estimated that players would naturally cooperate which they sometimes did, however we also had to adapt our interactions in order to facilitate cooperation in order for it to really work.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Furthermore we had to spend a lot of time regarding the difficulty and intuitiveness of the game, as many of our players either understood the game very quickly and performed well, or didn't understand the game quickly and thus performed worse. Having to design our interactions towards working for both of these groups was a challenge.</p>
